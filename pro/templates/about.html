					<h2>SneakStore</h2>
					<p>As a community-first sneaker and streetwear boutique in India, we aim to be zeitgeists. With our
						culture-to-commerce approach, we endeavour to be at the forefront of movements rooted in music,
						art, fashion and more.

						Through our platform and reach, we champion inclusivity, individuality and creative expression.
						Collaborating with creators from all over India and across the world, we create impactful
						stories and editorial content.</p>
					<p>The design of our apparel collections pays respect to the culture we come from. This collision of
						tradition and contemporary silhouettes speaks to our intention of being a streetwear brand from
						India - connected to our roots, relevant in the now, but creating the future.

						Since our inception in 2016, weâ€™ve evolved from a sneaker boutique and streetwear brand to
						become a cultural force that cultivates and shapes both sneakers and pop culture.</p>
